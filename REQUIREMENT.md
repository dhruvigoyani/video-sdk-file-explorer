VideoSDK — Task

1. Problem Statement
Build a reusable JavaScript File Explorer SDK and a React application that uses it.
The SDK should manage a hierarchical file and folder structure, while the React application provides an
interface to create, organize, search, and manage files and folders.
This task evaluates your understanding of:
1 JavaScript SDK design and API development
2 React component architecture and state management
3 Recursive rendering and nested data structures
4 Immutable state updates
5 Undo/redo and change notifications
6 React re-render behavior and performance awareness
Time Limit: 2 days
Technology: JavaScript, React, and Vite
2. Example Data Structure
Start with a file structure similar to the following:
My Files
├── Documents
│ ├── Resume.pdf
│ └── Project Plan.docx
├── Images
│ ├── Photo.png
│ └── Logo.svg
└── Notes.txt
Each file and folder should have a unique identifier, name, type, and parent reference.
The file system must be simulated in memory. Actual files and folders do not need to be created on the
computer's disk.
No backend or database is required.
3. Features to Implement
3.1. JavaScript SDK
Create a standalone JavaScript SDK that manages the file system independently of React.
Implement public methods for the following functionality:
1 Retrieve file structure — Return the complete hierarchy of files and folders.
2 Retrieve an item — Find a particular file or folder using its identifier.
3 Create a file — Add a new file inside a specified folder.
4 Create a folder — Add a new folder inside a specified parent folder.
5 Rename an item — Change the name of an existing file or folder.
6 Move an item — Move a file or folder to another folder.
7 Delete an item — Remove a file or folder and handle its descendants.
8 Search items — Find files and folders across the complete hierarchy.
9 Undo and redo — Reverse or reapply successful operations.
10 Subscribe to changes — Notify registered listeners when the file structure changes and allow subscriptions to
be removed.
You may choose the method names, parameters, return values, and internal data structure. Document the
public API and provide usage examples.

3.2. File and Folder Validation
The SDK must enforce the following rules:
1 Every item must have a stable, unique identifier.
2 Names must be unique within the same folder, ignoring letter casing.
3 Files cannot contain other files or folders.
4 A folder cannot be moved inside itself or any of its descendants.
5 Renaming or moving an item must preserve its identity.
6 Deleting a folder must correctly handle all its descendants.
7 Invalid operations must return meaningful errors without corrupting the file structure.
8 Data returned by the SDK must not allow consumers to modify its internal state directly.
3.3. Search Functionality
Implement search across the complete file hierarchy.
1 Search must be case-insensitive and include nested files and folders.
2 Allow filtering results by file or folder.
3 Display each result's name, type, and location in the hierarchy.
4 Support sorting and pagination.
5 Handle empty queries and invalid search options.
6 Ensure search results reflect changes made to the file system.
7 Searching must not modify the underlying data.
Search and filtering logic should be implemented in the SDK, while React should handle the search controls
and display the results.
3.4. Undo and Redo
Implement undo and redo functionality for file and folder operations.
1 Support undoing and redoing creation, renaming, moving, and deletion.
2 Undoing a folder deletion must restore its complete nested structure.
3 Failed operations must not create undo-history entries.
4 Define how redo history behaves when a new operation is performed after undo.
5 Undo and redo must not leave the file structure in an inconsistent state.
Document how your undo/redo history works.
4. React Application
4.1. Component Structure
Build a React application that uses the JavaScript SDK for all file-management operations.
The UI should include:
1 A recursive file tree displaying files and folders.
2 Expand/collapse functionality for folders.
3 Controls to create, rename, move, and delete items.
4 A search bar with filtering and sorting options.
5 A details panel displaying the selected item's information.
6 Undo and redo controls.
7 An activity panel showing recent changes.
8 Appropriate error messages for invalid operations.
Organize the interface into reusable components with clear responsibilities. Avoid implementing the entire
application in one large component.

4.2. React State and Hooks
1 Use React state for UI-specific information, such as the selected item, expanded folders, search input, and
pending UI actions.
2 Keep file-management logic and the source of truth inside the SDK.
3 Update the UI when the SDK reports changes.
4 Use React hooks appropriately for state management and side effects.
5 Subscribe to SDK changes and clean up subscriptions when components unmount.
6 Avoid duplicate subscriptions and unnecessary re-renders.
7 Ensure effect dependencies are handled correctly.
8 Handle asynchronous actions, pending states, and errors appropriately.
9 Ensure expanded folders and selected-item state behave consistently when the tree changes.
You may introduce custom hooks where they make the React integration more reusable.
The SDK must remain independent of React and should be usable from a non-React JavaScript application.
4.3. Rendering Behavior
Add a console.log inside the recursive tree component to observe re-render behavior.
Observe the rendering behavior while performing actions such as:
1 Expanding or collapsing folders.
2 Selecting a file.
3 Creating or renaming an item.
4 Deleting a folder and its descendants.
5 Updating the search query.
Structure the component hierarchy and state placement to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Explain any
optimization techniques used and why they are appropriate.
Visual polish is not the primary requirement. Focus on component structure, correct behavior, and
maintainability.
5. Automated Testing
Use a suitable JavaScript testing framework, such as Jest or Vitest.
Write tests covering the following scenarios:
1 Creating, renaming, moving, and deleting files and folders.
2 Rejecting duplicate names and invalid operations.
3 Preventing folders from being moved into their descendants.
4 Searching nested folders and updating results after mutations.
5 Undoing and redoing operations, including restoration of nested folders.
6 Registering and removing SDK subscriptions.
7 Ensuring returned data cannot modify the SDK's internal state.
8 React subscription cleanup, UI updates, and error handling.
Tests should cover both successful operations and important failure scenarios.

6. Bonus Discussion
6.1. Atomic Transactions
Extend the SDK to support executing multiple file-system operations as a single transaction.
1 All operations must succeed together, or none should be applied.
2 A failed transaction must not leave partial changes.
3 Notify subscribers only after a successful commit.
4 Treat a successful transaction as one undoable operation.
5 A failed transaction must not create an undo-history entry.
Design the public API for transactions and document how it works.
6.2. Multi-Selection and Bulk Operations
Extend the React application to support selecting multiple files and folders.
1 Allow users to select and deselect multiple items.
2 Display the number of selected items.
3 Support deleting selected items in one operation.
4 Clear the selection after a successful operation.
5 Preserve the selection and display an error if the operation fails.
If you implement atomic transactions, use them to handle bulk deletion as a single transaction.
7. Technical Constraints
1 Use JavaScript and React.
2 Implement the core file-management SDK yourself.
3 Do not use third-party file-management, event-emitter, or undo/redo libraries for the core functionality.
4 Do not use React state as the source of truth for file-system data.
5 Use an in-memory file structure; a backend or database is not required.
6 Standard libraries may be used for application setup, styling, and testing.
7 You may choose your own internal architecture, data structures, method names, and API design.
Document your key design decisions and known limitations.
